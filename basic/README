                             FastFiberBasic
                            ---------------

 Basic demonstration example of fastsim for optical fibre using a single
 WLS fiber.


 1. GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 ------------------------

 A 1.0m long, 1.0mm diameter WLS (Kuraray Y-11(200)S) fiber positioned
 at (x,y,z) = (1.0m,0.0m,0.0m). A SiPM (Hamamatsu S13615-1025) is attached
 at +z end while an ideal mirror is attached at -z end.

 2. AN EVENT : Incident optical photons
 ------------------------------------

 GEANT4 particle gun is used to fire optical photons to the WLS fiber.
 The photon energy around 2.8 eV (440nm) gives maximum WLS emission.


 3. VISUALIZATION
 ------------------

 The Visualization Manager is set in the main().
 The initialisation of the drawing is done via the command
 > /control/execute vis.mac

 An optical photon is visualized as a cyan colored track.


 4. PHYSICS
 ----------

 The material properties of WLS fiber is defined in the FastFiberBasicMaterials.cc.
 This example includes WLS absorption/emission spectra, light attenuation
 length of a fiber.


 5. HOW TO START ?
 -----------------

 - compile and link to generate an executable
      % cd basic
      % mkdir build
      % cmake ..
      % make

 - execute the program  in 'batch' mode from macro files
      % ./FastFiberBasic run1.mac

 - execute Test  in 'interactive mode' with visualization
      %  ./FastFiberBasic
         ...
      Idle> type your commands
         ...
      Idle> exit

 - several user defined commands
   /fastfiber/action/useGPS true : activate GPS particle generator instead of using GEANT4 particle gun
   /fastfiber/event/verbose 1 : print the information of optical photons which hit SD


 6. NTUPLE
 --------------
 This example generates ROOT ntuple which contains the properties of each optical photon detected in the SD:
 (All units are GEANT4 defaults)

 Energy (double): Energy of the optical photon
 Time (double): Global time when the optical photon hit SD
 PosX/Y/Z (double): Global position of the optical photon in X/Y/Z when the optical photon hit SD
 MomX/Y/Z (double): Momentum of the optical photon in X/Y/Z when the optical photon hit SD
 PolX/Y/Z (double): Polarization component of the optical photon in X/Y/Z when the optical photon hit SD
